# A walkthrough in Node Sequelite with RocketSteat
## A complete MVC program in backend with complex queries

It's a project focoused on showing some of cool queries that Nodejs along with [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/) and PasS [ElephantSQL](elephantsql.com)is capable of doing. 
It's just amzazing to see 3 layers of queries,
in this specific case: *find the user that matches its email with a specific domain, and it's location to a certain string that knows -in this example- React*. 

Very honored to made and study; hoping for more!
